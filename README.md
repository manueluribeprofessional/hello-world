Hello, my name is Manuel. I'm originally from Texas, but I'm living in New York. I don't know very much about coding except for the bare minimum when it comes to HTML and CSS stuff. I'm WAY more interested in database coding and Data Science branch of coding. I hope whom ever reads this is nice enough to help me on that journey. And if it's me reading this in the future, remember: this is about you putting things where they belong so you can help people find the things they need. Just as they helped you.
